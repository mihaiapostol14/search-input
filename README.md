# Search Input

A minimal and stylish search input component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project provides a clean, modern search input UI for web applications. The search box features smooth styling and an interactive button with a magnifying glass icon, powered by Font Awesome. The input automatically transforms user input so that only the first character is uppercase, with the rest in lowercase, enhancing consistency and user experience.
